## Raw Data


## Tidy Data
As laid out in the work of Hadley Wickham, each variable measured appears in one
column, each different observation of that variable appears in a different row, 
there is a single "kind" of so there is only one tidy data output. 

Each row of the tidy data set contains the mean of all measurements for a 
particular subject and activity. Each column contains a different variable. All
